## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant concern in today's digital world. This project showcases a machine learning approach using logistic regression to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging historical transaction data, this model aims to identify potentially fraudulent activities and provide early warnings to prevent financial losses.

## Features

- Utilizes logistic regression algorithm for fraud detection.
- Provides insights into the distribution of fraud and non-fraud transactions.
- Generates ROC curves and calculates the ROC AUC score for model evaluation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/dhrubaseal/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   $ cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

 - Load and preprocess the credit card dataset.
 - Train a logistic regression model for fraud detection.
 - Evaluate the model using ROC curve and ROC AUC score.
 - Explore the code for further analysis and improvement.

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved an ROC AUC score of 98. The ROC curve demonstrates the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
